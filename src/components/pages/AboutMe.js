      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Chenghao, and I'm an aspiring full stack developer,
        currently in the process of completing a Monash bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p> 
        While I may be new to the field, I'm passionate about codeing, and I'm excited to begin my journey as a professional developer. 
        Through my bootcamp studies, I've gained foundational knowledge to become a developer , and I'm eager to continue growing my skills and gaining experience in the field.
      </p>

        While I don't yet have extensive professional experience, I've worked on several projects during my bootcamp studies, 
        including Weather-Dashboard, Work-Day-Scheduler, Tech-blog... These projects have allowed me to gain practical experience and have helped me develop my problem-solving skills.
